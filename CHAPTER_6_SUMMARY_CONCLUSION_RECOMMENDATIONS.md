# CHAPTER SIX: SUMMARY, CONCLUSION, AND RECOMMENDATIONS

## 6.1 Summary of Findings

This study set out to design, develop, and evaluate `Creatuno` as a context-sensitive digital platform for Sierra Leonean creative professionals. Consistent with Chapter 1 and Chapter 3, findings are presented across problem resolution, objective attainment, and research-question response.

### 6.1.1 Problem-Resolution Findings (Linked to Chapter 1.3)

1. **Mentorship and professional development gap**  
   `Creatuno` implemented structured mentorship workflows (requests, offers, communication continuity), moving beyond ad hoc mentorship patterns.

2. **Portfolio visibility gap**  
   The platform implemented structured portfolio and project presentation with public discovery pathways, reducing reliance on transient social-media visibility.

3. **Low-bandwidth and connectivity constraints**  
   The PWA architecture, offline queue, and sync pipeline established practical resilience under intermittent internet conditions.

4. **Employment and monetization pathway gaps**  
   Opportunity and application flows, plus pitch and funding interactions, created a more formalized path between talent and economic opportunity.

5. **Digital fragmentation challenge**  
   Integrated modules in one platform reduced cross-tool friction and improved end-to-end process continuity.

### 6.1.2 Objective-Level Findings (Linked to Chapter 1.4)

| Study Objective | Finding | Attainment Level |
|---|---|---|
| Objective 1: requirements-informed analysis | Requirements translated into functional modules spanning visibility, mentorship, opportunity, and funding concerns | Achieved |
| Objective 2: mobile-first, low-bandwidth architecture | PWA and offline-first implementation delivered practical technical suitability | Achieved |
| Objective 3: portfolio management system | Portfolio and project workflows implemented with public-facing discoverability | Achieved |
| Objective 4: mentorship framework | Structured mentorship interaction pathways implemented | Achieved (pilot-scale) |
| Objective 5: employment and investment linkages | Opportunity and pitch funding pathways implemented | Achieved (with scale and governance enhancements needed) |

### 6.1.3 Research Question Response Summary (Linked to Chapter 1.5)

| Research Question | Consolidated Finding |
|---|---|
| RQ1: key challenges faced by creatives | Findings confirm interconnected barriers in mentorship, visibility, connectivity, and monetization pathways |
| RQ2: required platform functionality | Integrated, low-friction professional tooling is required for adoption in low-resource settings |
| RQ3: suitability of PWA approach | PWA is appropriate and technically effective for low-bandwidth, mobile-dominant contexts |
| RQ4: platform enhancement effect | Core workflows improve practical capability for showcasing, mentorship, and professional engagement |
| RQ5: user value/usability perception | Initial implementation evidence is positive; expanded longitudinal user evaluation remains necessary |

## 6.2 Contributions of the Study

### 6.2.1 Practical Contribution

The study produced a functional platform that consolidates portfolio, mentorship, opportunities, and funding interactions in one digital environment tailored to local constraints.

### 6.2.2 Policy and Ecosystem Contribution

The platform concept and implementation provide a digital instrument aligned with creative-economy development priorities, especially youth opportunity pathways and sector formalization.

### 6.2.3 Academic Contribution

The work contributes a context-grounded HCI4D/ICT4D case showing how low-bandwidth technical architecture and socio-professional workflows can be co-designed for emerging creative economies.

### 6.2.4 Technical Contribution

The project demonstrates a modular full-stack implementation pattern where offline-first PWA behavior, identity management, database-backed workflows, and payment integration can coexist in one maintainable system.

## 6.3 Conclusion

The dissertation objective was to deliver and evaluate a context-appropriate digital intervention for Sierra Leone's creative economy. On this basis, the study concludes that:

1. the developed system successfully addresses major structural pain points identified in Chapter 1;
2. the chosen architecture and module integration are suitable for the documented low-bandwidth context;
3. the platform provides a credible foundation for professional visibility, mentorship access, and opportunity linkage.

### 6.3.1 What Was Fully Achieved

- integrated multi-module platform delivery (portfolio, mentorship, opportunities, pitch and payments);
- low-bandwidth aware implementation through PWA and offline synchronization;
- pilot-ready workflow coverage across core problem domains.

### 6.3.2 What Was Partially Achieved

- large-scale mentorship network maturity and long-term interaction outcomes;
- broad quantitative evidence on sustained economic impact;
- advanced observability and automated testing maturity for production-grade scaling.

### 6.3.3 What Remains Outside Current Scope

In line with Chapter 1.8 and Chapter 3 limits:

- nationwide longitudinal impact measurement;
- full multilingual rollout beyond initial localization intent;
- large-scale institutional integration and policy deployment studies.

## 6.4 Recommendations

### 6.4.1 Immediate Technical Hardening (Short Term)

1. **Expand automated testing depth**  
   Add unit, integration, and end-to-end test layers for critical workflows.

2. **Strengthen data access controls**  
   Review and tighten row-level data policies and privileged paths for production readiness.

3. **Improve operational observability**  
   Introduce structured logs, error tracking, and alerting for sync and payment-critical flows.

4. **Formalize resilience safeguards**  
   Add stronger idempotency and reconciliation processes for payment and transaction reliability.

### 6.4.2 Product and Ecosystem Growth (Medium Term)

1. establish formal mentor recruitment and retention programs with ecosystem partners;
2. extend opportunity quality controls and trust indicators for employers and clients;
3. improve analytics dashboards for creatives, mentors, and institutional stakeholders;
4. deepen accessibility and inclusive UX guidance for users with varying digital literacy;
5. progressively extend localization strategy in line with user adoption evidence.

### 6.4.3 Research and Academic Continuation (Long Term)

1. conduct longitudinal studies on income stability and employment outcomes;
2. compare low-bandwidth platform interventions across cities and creative disciplines;
3. investigate mentorship model effectiveness and retention drivers in digital creative communities;
4. evaluate the relationship between offline-first usability and sustained platform engagement;
5. model policy-scale scenarios for integrating platform data into creative economy planning.

## 6.5 Final Remark

`Creatuno` demonstrates that a locally grounded, low-bandwidth-conscious digital platform can operationalize key goals of creative-sector empowerment in Sierra Leone. The project delivers both an applied software artifact and a validated foundation for future technical scaling, policy collaboration, and academic extension. With the recommended next steps, the platform can evolve from pilot-level viability toward robust ecosystem-level impact.
